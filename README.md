# üß† Linux Process and Job Management Project

This project was created by **Chukwudumebi Ugoji**, as part of my journey into **DevOps**.  
It demonstrates the fundamentals of **process and job management** in Linux using Bash scripting.



## üöÄ Project Overview

This Bash script automates the creation and management of background jobs and processes.  
It shows how to:

- Start background processes  
- List and manage jobs  
- Bring jobs to the foreground and back  
- Gracefully terminate processes  

This project is part of my foundational DevOps learning under the **Tech4Dev Fellowship Program**.



## üìú Script Code

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -m
# Process and Job Management Project
echo "starting two background process..."

sleep 500 &
SLEEP_PID=$!
echo "Started sleep 500 background with PID $SLEEP_PID"

tail -f /dev/null &
TAIL_PID=$!
echo "Started tail -f /dev/null in background with PID $TAIL_PID"

echo "LIST OF JOBS"
jobs

echo "LIST OF PROCESS"
ps -ef

echo "KILLING JOB 1 GRACEFULLY..."
kill -15 %1
ps -ef

echo "KILLING JOB 2 GRACEFULLY..."
kill -15 %2
ps -ef

echo "ALL PROCESS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED..."

Key Commands Explained

Command	Description

sleep 500 & : Runs the sleep command in the background for 500 seconds
tail -f /dev/null & :	Starts a dummy background process that keeps running
jobs :	Lists all background jobs currently running
ps -ef :	Lists all system processes and their details
fg %1 :	Brings background job 1 to the foreground
bg %1 :	Sends job 1 back to the background
kill -15 %1 :	Gracefully terminates job n using signal 15 (SIGTERM)

üß† What I Learned

From this project, I learned:

How Linux manages foreground and background jobs

The role of process IDs (PIDs) in monitoring running tasks

The difference between kill and kill -15 (graceful termination)

How to use key process management commands (jobs, ps, fg, bg, kill)


This hands-on practice deepened my understanding of how processes are handled at the system level ‚Äî a key concept in DevOps automation and server management.


üíª Tech Stack
